# Learning C++ — Small, Focused Practice Projects

This workspace is a personal learning playground for core C++ concepts: console I/O, control flow, arrays/vectors, functions, simple algorithms, and small game AI. Each source file is intentionally small so you can iterate quickly: add a feature, compile, run, refactor.

Files (quick overview)
- banking.cpp — menu-driven banking demo (state, functions).
- quiz.cpp — multiple-choice quiz (arrays of strings, loops, scoring).
- RPS.cpp — Rock-Paper-Scissors console game (randomness, input validation).
- sort.cpp — bubble-sort demo with step tracing.
- search.cpp — simple search example / utility.
- tictactoe.cpp — console Tic‑Tac‑Toe with Minimax AI (player vs computer).
- creditcardvalidation.cpp — credit card validation (Luhn algorithm + basic parsing / card-type hints).
- Compiled artifacts may be present in the workspace (binaries): banking, quiz, RPS, sort, search, tictactoe, creditcardvalidation
